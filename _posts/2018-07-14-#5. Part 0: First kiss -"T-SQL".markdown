Last week i spent on Querying Microsoft SQL Server 2014 course and really enjoyed it. I have never expected that i will work with querying SQL command to the Microsoft SQL Server database .From my point of view, after little experience with Python language ,queries on T-SQL look very plain (ha-ha, i was the person who was really  afraid using of SQL )
The course itself was very concise  - 20 modules in 5 days and you canâ€™t dive deeper without proper experience for last chapters. But anyway, i want to post some articles about T-SQL querying to strengthen obtained  knowledge.
